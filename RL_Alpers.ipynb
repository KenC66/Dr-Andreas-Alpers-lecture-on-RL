    "# Deep Reinforcement Learning: The Cross-Entropy Method\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "__Reinforcement Learning (RL)__ sits somewhere between __Supervised__ and __Unsupervised Learning.__\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Supervised Learning__: Training data $(x_i,y_i),$ $i=1,\\dots,$ with the $x_i$ representing data points and $y_i$ the corresponding label.<br>\n",
    "Examples: Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Bayes Classifiers, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Unsupervised Learning__: One just has data points $x_i,$ $i=1,\\dots,n,$ but not label.<br> \n",
    "Examples: Clustering algorithms, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), \n",
    "\n",
    "__Reinforcement Learning__ follows a different route. RL differs from supervised learning in a way that in supervised learning the training data has the answer key with it so the model is trained with the correct answer itself whereas in RL, there is no answer but the reinforcement agent decides what to do to perform the given task. In the absence of a training dataset, it is bound to learn from its experience. <br>\n",
    "Examples: \n",
    "* [Game Playing](https://www.deepmind.com/research/highlighted-research/alphago), \n",
    "* [Robotics](https://www.aiperspectives.com/artificial-intelligence-and-robotics), \n",
    "* [Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05115), \n",
    "* [Mathematics (finding constructions/counterexamples to open conjectures)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14516).\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning can be viewed as being a technique for solving Markov decision processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A __Markov decision process__ is a tuple $(\\Omega, A, T, R)$ in which\n",
    "* $\\Omega$ is the set of __states__,\n",
    "* $A$ is a finite set of __actions,__\n",
    "* $T$ is a __transition function__ $T:\\Omega\\times A \\times \\Omega\\to [0,1],$ which, for $T(\\omega,a,\\omega'),$ gives the probability that action $a$ performed in state $\\omega$ will lead to state $\\omega',$\n",
    "* and $R$ is a __reward function__ defined as $R:\\Omega \\times A \\to \\mathbb{R}.$\n",
    "\n",
    "A __policy__ $\\rho$ is a function $\\rho:\\Omega \\to A,$ which tells the agent which action to perform in any given state. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of learning in this context is to learn (i.e., find) a policy that gathers rewards:\n",
    "\n",
    "* DISCOUNTED REWARD: $ \\max\\mathbb{E}[\\sum_{t=0}^\\infty \\gamma^t r_t]$ with $0\\leq \\gamma \\leq1$ a fixed constant. \n",
    "\n",
    "A lower $\\gamma$ makes \n",
    "rewards from the uncertain far future less important for our agent \n",
    "than the ones in the near future that it can be fairly confident \n",
    "about. It also encourages agents to collect reward closer in time \n",
    "than equivalent rewards that are temporally far away in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea behind Q-learning is that if we had a function\n",
    "$Q^*: \\Omega \\times A \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, that could tell\n",
    "us what our return would be, if we were to take an action in a given\n",
    "state, then we could easily construct a policy that maximizes our\n",
    "rewards:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\\rho^*(s) = \\arg\\!\\max_a \\ Q^*(s, a)\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we don't know everything about the world, so we don't have\n",
    "access to $Q^*$. But, since neural networks are universal function\n",
    "approximators, we can simply create one and train it to resemble\n",
    "$Q^*$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deep Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "This brings us to Deep Reinforcement Learning, i.e., Reinforcement Learning using deep neural networks. We discuss one particular method, the so-called __Cross-Entropy__ method. This method is, of course, not always the best method, but it has its own strenghts. The most important ones are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Simplicity__: The cross-entropy method is really simple (<100 lines of code) and intuitive. \n",
    "* __Good convergence__: In environments that don't require complex, multistep policies to be learned and discovered and have short episodes with frequent rewards, cross-entropy usually works very well. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will introduce and discuss this method by discussing the rather popular RL environment FrozenLake. The FrozenLake environment is part of the OpenAI's Gym package, which gives several tools to simulate and compare RL approaches. \n",
    "\n",
    "### FrozenLake\n",
    "\n",
    "You and your friends were tossing around a frisbee at the park when you made a wild throw that left the frisbee out in the middle of the lake (G). The water is mostly frozen (F), but there are a few holes (H) where the ice has melted.\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](Frozen-Lake.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you step into one of those holes, you’ll fall into the freezing water. At this time, there’s an international frisbee shortage, so it’s absolutely imperative that you navigate across the lake and retrieve the disc. However, the ice is slippery, so you won’t always move in the direction you intend.\n",
    "\n",
    "The episode ends when you reach the goal or fall in a hole. You receive a reward of 1 if you reach the goal, and zero otherwise."

    "__Task__: Make adaptations to the above code (i.e. use the cross-entropy method from deep inforcement learning) to find the so-called Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) of the sequence [17, 15, 3, 22, 9, 13, 33, 21, 50, 40, 50, 42, 65, 60, 5, 70]. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The Longest Increasing Subsequence Problem asks to find a subsequence of a given sequence in which the subsequence's elements are sorted in an ascending order and in which the subsequence is as long as possible. For instance, the LIS of the sequence [0, 8, 4, 12, 2, 10, 6, 14, 1, 9, 5, 13, 3, 11, 7, 15] is [0, 2, 6, 9, 11, 15].\n",
    "\n",
    "__Hints__: The following are just hints. You don't need to follow them as long as you find a rather long increasing subsequence with your code. Aim for finding the longest increasing subsequence.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* You have to think about how you want to represent the states and actions. (For instance, you can represent the current selection of the subsequence by a binary 0/1 vector, where a 1 in position i represents that you have currently chosen the ith term in the sequence; an action could be a binary vector with a single 1 representing the term which you want to add to the subsequence.) \n",
    "\n",
    "* You probably need to program three mini-functions: One that gives you an initial state, one that selects an action as recommened by your NN, and one that performs a specified action given a state.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Don't use this line \"while reward_mean < REWARD_GOAL:\". Substitute is an appropriate way so that you find the longest (or at least a rather long) increasing subsequence of the given input sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "* An episode could create an increasing subsequence. Then the corresponding reward could be the length of this increasing subsequence. "
